A initiative to build a full stack project right from scratch. 
It is basically a form wherein I have provided all the crud operations which are as follows:-
1. Anyone can create their profile
2. Anyone can search for a profile or retrieve the entire profile data stored in the database
3. Anyone can update their profile with the help of their id
4. Anyone can delete their profile with the help of their id

I understand that it doesen't involve a much of that complexities and there are many improvements in it
but still inorder for me to make a grand project I thought I should start with a simple full stack mern application.
